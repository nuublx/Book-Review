It's a Asp.NET Web API project,
It's a Book Reviewing Project,
There is two kinds of users Admins,
Who can do CRU Operations on Books, Authors, Categories, and only delete Reviews and Reviewers Accounts.
Also there is Reviewers and they are the regular users who can add reviews, search for Books, Authors, and other people's reviews.
I'm creating this project in my learning journey of being a backend engineer using ASP.NET, Entity Framework, SQL Server, and also REST APIs
